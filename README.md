## General Information <a name="general-information"></a>

The Services Team Web Components Repository is meticulously crafted to optimize the orchestration of CSS and JS libraries utilized in diverse client projects. As the architects of web components designed to enhance the aesthetics and customization options for airTRFX client pages, the Services Team employs GitHub as the centralized repository to house the CSS and JS codebase that powers these components.

Our commitment to consolidating this codebase on GitHub is rooted in the pursuit of a streamlined and cohesive approach to managing web components. This consolidation not only fosters a singular and easily accessible location for our code but also establishes a foundation for a unified and efficient workflow. Through this, we empower our team to seamlessly maintain and update web components, ensuring that the enhancements made to the client pages are harmoniously integrated.

By entrusting the management of our codebase to the Services Team on GitHub, we not only centralize our efforts but also establish a collaborative environment where team members can collectively contribute to the evolution of our web components. This collaborative spirit is fundamental to the continuous improvement and innovation that define the Services Team's commitment to delivering exceptional, personalized web experiences for airTRFX clients.
