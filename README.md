# Services Team Web Components Repository

Welcome to the Services Team Web Components GitHub repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for CSS and JS libraries created by the EM Services Team. As the exclusive contributors, our team has the authority to modify libraries for various clients. The repository consists of a general CSS and JS repository that shares common code for all clients. Additionally, each client may have one or more unique libraries for JS and CSS to customize their specific design elements, such as colors or font sizes.
